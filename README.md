# ShoreCodeChallenge
A cold code challenge proposed by Shore Company

#####################################################################################################################################
Welcome to the Ofï¬‚ine Challenge for the Job Opening Website Development (Intern)

I tried to follow exactly the mockups provided by the Design team.

For a better resolution and experience , the website page works as well in widescreens and mobile. you can reduce the size of the screen using the ctrl + the roller of the mouse to slide until 70% and you can use chrome dev tools to try further sizes of mobiles.


I tried to use metatags from schema.org like  property="name" and property="description"
always use alt tag for images  and " typeof ="url"  for the links  

the use of "em" , "strong" , "p", "blockquote" , "h1".."h6" tags to give a meaning to HTML content (semantic HTML).
the code is SEO- friendly with using different tags and description for a better understanding from search engines.

Bulma, semantic HTML tags, less frameworks and some animations were used in the code.

Thank you for this opportunity to practice more the features of Bulma and webpacks.
